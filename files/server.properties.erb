# Server checks connecting players against Minecraft's account database. Only
# set this to false if your server is not connected to the Internet. Hackers
# with fake accounts can connect if this is set to false! If minecraft.net is
# down or inaccessible, no players will be able to connect if this is set to
# true. Setting this variable to off purposely is called "cracking" a server,
# and servers that are presently with online mode off are called "cracked"
# servers, allowing players with unlicensed copies of Minecraft to join.
#   true  - Enabled. The server will assume it has an Internet connection and check every connecting player.
#   false - Disabled. The server will not attempt to check connecting players.
